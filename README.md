# Analysis-for-Heteroatom-doped-graphene
Codes and raw data for analysis of heteroatom-doped graphene electrode properties
The raw data for analysis is combined in the excel spreadsheet "Heteroatomdopedgraphene.xlsx"
The MATLAB script is also provided here "GrapheneSC_analysis.m"
Note: Both files need to be contained in the same directory after downloading in order to run all the analysis code.
